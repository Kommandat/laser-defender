# laser-defender

This is a project I am making for my computer science practicum class at Harvey Mudd College (https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS189Spring2016). For this project I will be making a simple tower-defense video game using Swift and Sprite Kit. I hope to expand this project into a more complex video game that I can put on the App Store.
